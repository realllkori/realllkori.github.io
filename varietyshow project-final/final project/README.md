For the variety show project, I utilised a Bootstrap model for the layout design.
Below are specifc explanations for the website:

Homepage:
VPRODUCE, as the title and logo of the website, is placed at the left top of the navigation. The global navigation is divided into 'homepage', 'about VPRODUCE', 'Make your own variety show' and 'contact'.
The horizontal canvas placed in the middle shows the background picture and the slogan. The button 'to know more' leads to a short video below showing the basic information of the competition. Below the video users could also click on 'click to apply' that leads to the page for signing up.
The following section is 'Weekly trending', with three thumbnails listed presenting trending shows of different countries. By clicking each thumbnail users could view brief descriptions for different variety shows in a pop-up window, and within each windown users are allowed to click on 'click to watch' and go to the 'variety show' page.
The next section is 'monthly events', with similar design and functions, users can click on each on to view  recent activies (meet producers/emcees and travel to variety show spots)
Below are some fictional sponsored advertisement.
Contact information is placed as the footer, and users are allowed to submit a form/click on the icons to contact the 'office'

About
Quite similar to homepage.
The page first shows the offered resources of the competition (funding, equipment,tutorials, cooperation) ,and the button below will lead to the signup page.
The 'rules and procedure' is also designed as a list of thumbnails, and by clicking on each users could view details.

Signup
The button below the slogan will lead to the form filling section.
I included an Airtable form
The guide for application is a short video explaining rules and preparation

Watch variety shows
The button below the title leads to the section for watching variety shows
The data section will utilise Airtable and Json
The 'watch variety show' section is also presented a thumbnails, and by clicking each users could view highlights of each variety show. They are also allowed to trace a link included in each thumbnail to view the complete show.

Contact
By clicking on 'contact us' in the navigation users can directly go to the bottom of the page, which contains contact info.

FYI
All the data/videos are not ready yet so they are not quite related to the content for now:)
